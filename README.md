# RPS-NN
Rock, paper, scissors neural network using MicroMLP

This was created as a project for a subject at Veracruz Institute of Technology

A massive advantage was given to the neural network in terms of what is considered as a taken decision, thus this software should not be considered as a serious implementation of the module used.
This code is rather unfinished and was just a small showcase of what can be accomplished with the use of the MircoMLP micro Python module.
The testing was done runing the code on an Esp-32 development board using thonny, however it can be run on a linux terminal or an IDE.

In order to be able to run the code, it has to be located in the same folder as the MicroMLP module, or in case you wish to run it on an ESP-32 board using thonny you will need to save the module first to the board's internal memory.
Module is available at: https://github.com/jczic/MicroMLP
For the UI code from here was used: https://realpython.com/python-rock-paper-scissors/

Feel free to do anything with this code, it's just to have some fun.
